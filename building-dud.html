      I particularly liked the navigation bar of the Purple Zeus  website. The hover dropdown menus make it easy for users to navigate around the  website and figure out the layout of the website easily. This inspired the  navigation bar of my own website where I attempted to create a similar design  which results in the same result.<br>

      The design of body text being centred on the page was  inspired from NESA&rsquo;s own website. Centred text allows the user to focus on the  content of the text easier as they do not have to read from left to right along  the whole length of the webpage. </p>

    <h1><a name="_Toc11815825">Planning involved for the 8-week project</a></h1>
    <p>Planning and documentation for this project involves tools  such as a Gantt chart and a work log.  A  Gantt chart breaks down a project into smaller components and visually  representation of the scheduling of tasks with expected and actual durations of  each task. <br>

      In addition to this, designing tools such as a storyboard,  data flow diagram, context diagram and system flowchart are used to assist in  the planning of projects. <br>
      These tools help to understand the task better. This is  critical because gaining a good understanding of the assigned task determines  how the project will be done and what is required of the solution. A  feasibility study is undertaken to help decide on the project&rsquo;s path moving  forward by looking for problems and offering recommendations. By using design  tools, the inputs and outputs, processes, logic and layout can be figured out. </p>

    <h1><a name="_Toc11815827">Feasibility study</a></h1>
    <h4>Technical feasibility</h4>
    <p>Doing research and gaining resources for a project of this  nature is easy as modern technology is readily available and allows students  like me to access information quickly. The technology I have (laptop and  desktop pc) are more than sufficient to complete this task effectively and  efficiently. Compatibility between multiple browsers is possible, though not  completely focused on due to the time restraints of the project.</p>
    <h4>Economic feasibility</h4>
    <p>Because I am a student, there are minimal costs involved in  the creation of this project. Costs such as development cost and operational  costs do involve the server hosting and domain name fees. Though there are  these fees, as a student I gain intangible benefits from this opportunity to  showcase my skills to a public website as a portfolio. </p>
    <h4>Scheduling feasibility</h4>
    <p>The required information technology is quick and easy to  access and obtain through the internet. As a student doing the assignment by  myself, factors such as other personnel and employees and retraining are not  considered. Because the project is an assignment, deadlines are mandatory and  must be met. If they are not met, the possible consequences involve n-warnings  and lower marks for this course. On top of this, sharing time with studying and  developing other assessments will prove as a difficult time restraint. Development  of the solution is monitored and controlled with the use of scheduling tools  such as a work log and Gantt chart. </p>
    <h4>Operational feasibility</h4>
    <p>Because there is a limited amount of resources available  online for the IPT subject, the solution is feasible and may result in benefits  such as increased benefits to my website and increased recognition of my skills  to peers and possible employers. As a student doing a one-person project, I am  the operations manager of this project. Therefore, there is no need for  consideration of support from employees or other participants of the solution.  Though this results a lack of an important resource, time, instead of people.  Because I am the operations manager, I know my level of technical expertise and  my own limits, which makes it much easier for me to plan the project.</p>
    <h1><a name="_Toc11815828">Forms of media</a></h1>
    <p>The forms of media I will use are: images, web links, text and  interactivity. On the website, the logo is represented as a vector image. This  allows for the logo to develop further as my graphic design skills improve. I  have chosen a vector image because it can be scaled without losing any quality,  and has a much smaller file size than JPG files. 3D CAD is not used because it  is not essential to the explanation and demonstration of the topic the website  will cover. 3D CAD is also too time-consuming and complex for concepts that can  be explained with more simple diagrams and animations. Video is also not  necessary to demonstrate concepts in the topic, and can be done with an  animation instead. Relevant audio can be used to enhance understanding of a  concept when combined in a video.</p>
    <h1><a name="_Toc11815829">Version 2 requirements report</a></h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Video is not able to be done due to time  restraints</li>
      <li>Audio is mixed but not used because the video is  not made</li>
      <li>Each page has a banner for the header with a  fade-in animation</li>
      <li>Website logo to differentiate between other  websites</li>
      <li>Hovering over different links in the navigation  bar produce a coloured background</li>
      <li>New hover dropdown menu for the IPT section of  the navigation bar</li>
      <li>No animation for content due to time restraints</li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a name="_Toc11815830">Justify choice of authoring tools for each component</a></h1>
    <p>Adobe Illustrator was used to create the website logo. This  is because Illustrator allows the creation of vector-based images, which allow  for small file sized and scalable images for different display sizes. <br>
      An online tool called <a href="https://tweenui.com/">TweenUI</a> was used to create each one of the header banners. It allows for quick and easy  creation of animated website banners which can then be exported as multiple  file types, depending if you are a paying user or not. Because I am using the  service completely free, my banners are exported in the GIF file type. <br>
      Although audio is not used due to time restraints, an audio  clip has been mixed in Audacity, which was to be used in a video. Audacity is  one of the best tools to record and edit audio because it is free source and  has enough functionality even for professionals to use.</p>
    <h1><a name="_Toc11815831">Optimising of all images (filetype, size etc.)</a></h1>
    <p>To optimise images, they are commonly compressed and saved  as JPG files. JPG is a type of lossy compression for images which allow for  small file sized while still having enough quality to be viewed on the World  Wide Web.<br>
      The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file format is chosen for  the website logo because it allows the logo to be scaled on any device of any  size. Furthermore, because of its nature as a vector image, the file size is  smaller than bitmap filetypes.  <br>
      For example: The website logo is both exported from Adobe  Illustrator as a JPEG file and a SVG file.<br>
  <img border="0" width="505" height="45" src="images/building_clip_image011.png"><br>
      However, the JPEG file is 26 times larger than the SVG file.  This is because vector images are saved as lines of algorithms instead of  pixels like JPG files, resulting in much less data to save.</p>
    <h1><a name="_Toc11815832">Justify and demonstrate use of tools to assist with  planning</a></h1>
    <p>A decision tree is not appropriate to the planning of my  project as it is hierarchical and information fits in categories. An example of  a project where a decision tree is appropriate is a game, where navigation is  non-linear and event outcomes are important.<br>
      A data dictionary is not appropriate to the project either.  A data dictionary for CSS would be too complicated because it has many classes,  selectors and declarations within these classes and selectors. Therefore, it is  not a practical way to represent metadata.<br>
      Updated files are regularly uploaded to the server. This  allows for testing of the website and its functionality by checking if all  features are working properly and checking all links are working and that they  go to the intended page. Test data is not appropriate as there is no input  going into the website.<br>
      Because the website design is simple and does not require  many processes, a data flow diagram is not needed. <br>
      An operation manual or help system is not necessary as the  website is hierarchical, which allows the user to easily find their way around  the website according to categories. <br>
      A context diagram helps to understand the process of simple  operations that occur within the system. For example, below is a context  diagram which shows the process of accessing content on a website.<br>
  <img border="0" width="571" height="81" src="images/building_clip_image012.jpg"></p>
    <br clear="all">
    <p>A storyboard is a tool used to represent the navigation of  hypermedia. For a website, storyboards are used to show the navigational layout  of the web pages.<br>
      <img width="603" height="341" src="images/building_clip_image013.png"></p>
    <br clear="all">
    <p>A system flowchart is a visual way of representing flow of  data and the logic of a system including hardware and software. It shows the  processes and sequence of all events that occur in the system.<br>

    <h1>Ethical ramifications of the overall  project</h1>
    <p>My project assists in the learning of other students  studying the Information Processes and Technology course. By using my website  as a supplement to in-class learning, students can gain a greater understanding  of the IPT course through simple diagrams and learn small details. Some  students may choose to bludge in class, thinking that relying solely on online  resources will be enough to pass their course, but this is in fact a hinderance  to their learning, and so educational websites must be used in caution.<br>
      Because this website is used to teach people about a  government approved course, the information must be timely and accurate. If the  information on the website is not accurate, viewers will be misinformed, and  their learning hindered due to the conflicting information they receive. <br>
      This website does not collect data nor store any data from  visitors to the site, therefore each visitor&rsquo;s privacy and confidentiality is  guaranteed. Furthermore, the website uses HTTPS to ensure visitors a secure  connection to the server without risk of being redirected to a malicious site.</p>
    <h1><a name="_Toc11815834">Ethical considerations of relevant project  components</a></h1>
    <p>Though communication systems are a large part of modern  society and bring great benefits to all people, there are also social and ethical  issues that arise from the technology. This includes the issues in messaging  systems and general use of the internet. Online messaging systems provide a  free and instantaneous way to communicate with people from all over the world.  However, it is not as secure as traditional methods of communication such as  speaking face-to-face. This means that privacy and confidentiality of users is not  being guaranteed and their messages may be intercepted or read by other people. <br>
      Misinterpretation of information is also an important issue  in the use of communication systems. Because of the omission of context, body  language and/or tone that is normally present in face-to-face communication,  this may result in phrases being interpreted incorrectly by the receiver of the  message.<br>
      Communication systems greatly impact the nature of work and  business. Through internet trading or e-commerce, new jobs in the information  technology industry are constantly being created. Internet shopping also  provides customers with new ways to purchase and receive goods with the  introduction of online orders and delivery to customer&rsquo;s doors. In contrast to  this, jobs such as retail at shop fronts are being taken away or fewer people  being employed because of the development of e-commerce.  In addition to this, internet banking allows  customers to view all their banking details and perform various banking  functions such as viewing account balance and transferring money. This means  that employees of banks are not required to perform these tasks, requiring  people with more skills in information technology and less banking skills. <br>
      All aspects of the website are visual, and there is no  audio. This makes it impossible for any person with hearing impairment to learn  from the content on the website. <br>
      High contrast between text and background allows readers to  read content clearly without any confusion.</p>
